The Alien RPG Companion App Ver 1.0.0 - by Micah Popp - 2024

First of all I want to say thank you for downloading my program!
My ultimate goal for publishing this application is to build out a professional portfolio with Python,
secondarily though, I wanted to make a program that I figured could be of utility to anyone who GMs for the Alien RPG!

There are a number of revamps that I would like to do in the future, but in truth, its very unlikely that I'll
actually return to this app as I'll be fleshing out other programing projects for my portfolio

IN THAT RESPECT HOWEVER, I am hungry for programming feedback.  If you have any feedback as to how I could improve my code-writing, please contact me at @Koilcoatl on discord!  Please no hateful or hurtful comments, I am only looking for constructive criticism.



One last thing!  If you feel you could make this application better, I welcome you to!  This program has its source code included with the zip so that you can adjust it to your liking.  I only ask that you keep my name attached to it in some way!

Thanks again for trying out my program, I hope it fits your needs!
